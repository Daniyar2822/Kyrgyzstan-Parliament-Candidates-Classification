# Kyrgyzstan-Parliament-Election-Prediction
Prepared as a final project of a Python and Data Science course taken from the American University of Central Asia.
In this repository I used datasets, containing information on candidates in Parliamentary Election in the Kyrgyz Republic held in 28 Nov 2021, scraped from publicly open webportal of Central Election Comission (talapker.shailoo.gov.kg).
Using various preprocessing techniques, I wrangled and cleaned data as well as visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn packages.
Then I used skikit-learn package I built decision-tree model to predict whether the candidate will be elected or not. Also desicion-tree model demonstrated which variables are more significant
